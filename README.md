# Research script of robots.txt parsers for PHP and other languages

See [the feature/behavior test result in wiki](https://github.com/ranvis/robots-txt-processor-test/wiki/Features).

TODO: describe usage and YAML schema

# Note

This project is started as a research of robots.txt parsers to find out which one is best suited for my need.
While the test runner can show failing tests on other module, A failure doesn't necessarily mean a bug of the module.
Since there's no real RFC for robots.txt, there are no correct behaviors for some of notations and each module is more or less implemented in its own right way.
